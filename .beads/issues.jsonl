Delete branch protection rule for `dev`\n2. Update branch protection for `main` (require PR, require CI)\n3. Delete `dev` branch from remote\n\n## New Workflow\nfeature-branch → PR → main → Release Please auto-tags","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-19T01:14:03.654501359-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-19T01:22:32.013910129-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-19T01:22:32.013910129-05:00","close_reason":"PR #93 merged, migration complete"}
